Each CR1000 program has a unique signature value created as a hash of all the text
in the program.  This is stored in the progSig variable, and is output as a field
in all datatables so that each record can be linked to a speific program.  Note that
the program signature is also stored in the datatable header when it is retrieved
from the datalogger; however, the header program signature value only necessarily 
applies to the latest data records, and may not apply to older records.
