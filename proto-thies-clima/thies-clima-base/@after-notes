Thies CLIMA is the manufacturer of the LPM (laser precipitation
monitor) and U3D (ultrasonic 3D anemometer).  These instruments can
operate in 'bus mode' using RS485, since they respond only to
commands with the correct instrument ID.

The LPM manual, under Command BD (p28/66), says (sic):
    The latency period is 20 ms.  This means that after sending of a
    command within 20 ms the switching of the direction must happen.
    And after receiving a answer from the sensor at the earliest time of
    20 ms a command can be send.

The U3D manual seems to not mention this topic at all, but in initial
testing at 115200 baud rate, many skipped commands or responses were
seen until the CRBasic serialOpen() TxDelay parameter was set to 20000,
representing 20000 usec or 20 msec.

The CRBasic serialOpen() format parameter is 3, for:
    3:  logic 1 low, binary, no parity, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits
