ISAW FlowCapt measures particle flux (g/m^2/s) and wind speed (km/hr) by acoustic means.
Wind speed is rescaled after measurement to m/s.
Wiring:
    WHT -- PWR (12V, 20 mA max, <1 mA quiescent)
    BLK -- PWR GND
    BLU -- SDI12
    BRN -- SDI12 GND
    GRY -- RX (not used for logger)
    PNK -- TX (not used for logger)
