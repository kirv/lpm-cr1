NAME
    proto-logger/metadata-file

SYNOPSIS
    metadata-file.metadata(tag as string, value as string) as long


DESCRIPTION
    This component provides support for storing arbitrary 'tag=value' lines in a file
    created on the logger at startup.

    Before the first scan in the program, open file USR:metata.txt, then use metadata() 
    function to post TAG=VALUE pairs to it.  Close the file when done.
