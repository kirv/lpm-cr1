The two digital output channels of the LPM can be wired to CR1000
control port channels if desired.  Several choices are available
to configure each digital output (D1:x and D2:x), and the CR1000
would be responsible to decode the signal to extract information.

Functions are provided to decode the LPM's frequency-mapped signals
for D1/2 parameters 17 and 19 and output a Synop/METAR code for the
current instrument state.  The same information is available in 
Telegram 5, so this would be somewhat redundant.

Other uses might be possible, including using D1/2 parameter 13 to
output the LPM's totalized precipitation (in 0.1 mm increments).
