Campbell Scientific SR50A sonic rangers are used for measuring snow depth by measuring the time taken for 
a transmitted 'ping' to be echoed back up to the transducer.  The measured time is transformed to a distance
assuming the ambient air temperature is 0 degC.

The SR50A uses the SDI12 protocol, so can support multiple sensors on a single datalogger
control port for communications at 1200 baud, using the CRBasic SDI12Recorder() instruction.

Each sensor on a SDI12 bus (shared communications control port) must have a unique address
or ID number.  The default address for a new sensor is 0.  In this program, each SR50A sensor
will have the ordinal number for the address.
