At the end of each day, a message is logged to the Messages table with the current LPM
time (ZT), the LPM runtime hours (ZB), the error and warning bit mapped values, and the LPM 
totalized precipitation (PT).  The LPM precipitation total is then zeroed (RA) -- or would
be if the command were to be uncommented.

A srategy is needed to determine when (or if) to reset the LPM totalized precipitation.
Daily reset would be on an obvious time boundary, but other intervals might make sense,
e.g., weekly, every 10 days, monthly (e.g., on minute 0 of day 1 of each month); this 
depends on how this information is used, if at all.
