Geonor vibrating wire transducers are connected through a signal
conditioner to pulse or control ports on the CR1000.  The frequency
of each wire is measured by pulse counts every 10 seconds and logged
to the Geonor datatable.

Calibration constants for the wire transducers  are defined in
constants, and are recorded to the Messages datatable on startup.
