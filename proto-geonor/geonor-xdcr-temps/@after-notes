A thermistor is taped to each Geonor vibrating wire transducer body to investigate
possibly implementing temperature correction.  Resistance values are logged in the
Geonor table every 10 seconds.

Averaged resistance values are converted to temperatures and logged every 60 seconds
in the Geonor table.

Thermistor conversion coefficients are logged to the Messages table on startup.
