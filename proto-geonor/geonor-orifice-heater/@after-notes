The Geonor heater kit is installed, with heating pads inside and
outside the orifice, and controlled by a solid state relay from a
CR1000 control port.  An RTD is fixed to the orifice and measured
for the orifice temperatures, and logged in the Various table every
minute..

Functions:
    gnr_htr_strategy(AT, RH, orifice_T) -- returns a duty cycle control setpt value

    htr_relay_control(ratio, period) -- runs the heater according to the duty cycle

A strategy for heating will need to be defined.
