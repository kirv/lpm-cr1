# lpm-cr1

This repository is for developing a program to run on a Campbell
Scientific CR1000 datalogger to interface to a Laser Precipitation
Monitor (LPM), manufactured by Thies Clima.  The program might
hopefully be useful to talk to more than one LPM instrument, though
for now only one is anticipated in the short term.

The program will likely be combined with other programs, e.g., one
to interface to a Geonor precipitation gauge with vibrating wire
transducers.
