This repository represents datalogger programs intended for several
research sites installed and run by UAF/GI/GINA for ARM.

Program texts are generated by the thinobject ProgramBuilder-CRBasic
system.  Programs are comprised of compoenents, each containing
program chunks which are agreggated as output.

Thinobject types Object, Directory, and ProgramBuilder-CRBasic are
contained in .tob-lib/, each containing executable methods for the
type.

The thinobject handler or executive is tob and several utility 
programs are contained in bin/.

The file .bashrc can be sourced to set up the environment to 
run thinobject methods on the objects.

Objects include target datalogger sites and prototype objects
which represent spefific instruments or systems.
